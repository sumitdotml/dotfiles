# Some Nice Motions and Shortcuts

Some nice motions and shortcuts I want to get used to using in Neovim:

- `cib` - Change inside brackets. When I am either inside a pair of parentheses or at the start of a (say) function, this motion will delete the content inside the brackets and put me in insert mode inside the brackets.

- `ciw` - "Change inside word". When my cursor is either inside a word or at the start of a word, this motion will delete the word and put me in insert mode that replaces the word.

- `ci"` or `ci'` - "Change inside quotes". When my cursor is either inside a pair of quotes (either single or double quotes) or at the start of a quoted string, this motion will delete the content inside the quotes and put me in insert mode inside the quotes.

- `viw` - "Visual inside word". This will select the word under the cursor, allowing me to perform operations on it.

- `vib` - "Visual inside brackets". This will select the content inside the brackets, allowing me to perform operations on it.

- `vi"` or `vi'` - "Visual inside quotes". This will select the content inside the quotes, allowing me to perform operations on it.

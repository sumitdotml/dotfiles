# My Dotfiles

This is still in progress. I am learning by doing this.

I want to get better at doing everything inside the terminal (I really like neovim's vibes), so thi is my attempt at trying to get better at this.

Currently, I mostly use:

- neovim
- ghostty (terminal)
- tmux

### To-Dos

- [ ] Add autocomplete
- [ ] My neovim environment could look better (sidebar, lualine, etc. all need tweaks).

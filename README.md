# My Dotfiles

I am learning by doing this. I don't use this workflow all the time; I get into this workflow when I've finished creating a mental model of how I want to do something (say, a neural network architecture) and no longer need to ask questions to the internet (or to language models inside Cursor). Helps to keep me away from distractions.

I want to eventually consolidate my workflow to this, but I'm not there yet (I still use Cursor Chat to talk to language models to learn difficult concepts; I find it quite efficient). But I'm getting there.

#

Currently, I use Neovim, Ghostty, and tmux for my workflow.

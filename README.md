# My Dotfiles

This is still in progress. I am learning by doing this.

I want to get better at doing everything inside the terminal (I really like neovim's vibes), so thi is my attempt at trying to get better at this.

Currently, I mostly use:

- neovim
- ghostty (terminal)
- (sometimes) tmux

I've been using tmux way less these days since ghostty allows me to split panes as well, and frankly tmux interferes with the color schemes of neovim and me being a dude obsessed over minute details, I just had to find a way. And that way was ghostty!

### To-Dos

- [ ] Finish configuring the LSPs in my neovim setup.
- [ ] Add autocomplete
- [ ] My neovim environment could look better (sidebar, lualine, etc. all need tweaks).
- [ ] Normalize the bindings accorss neovim as well as ghostty.
- [ ] some more... will think later my head hurts atm

# My Dotfiles

This is still in progress. I am learning by doing this.

I want to get better at doing everything inside the terminal (I really like neovim's vibes), so thi is my attempt at trying to get better at this.

Currently, I mostly use:

- neovim
- ghostty (terminal)
- tmux

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/sumitdotml/mydotfiles.git

```
Or ssh:

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:sumitdotml/mydotfiles.git
```

2. Go to the cloned directory in your terminal

```zsh
cd mydotfiles
```

3. Run this command (you need to be inside the `mydotfiles` directory:

```zsh
./install.sh
```

**Note**: you need to have [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) installed before all these steps.

### To-Dos

- [ ] Add autocomplete
- [ ] My neovim environment could look better (sidebar, lualine, etc. all need tweaks).
